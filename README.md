# LearnerFlow Dashboard

LearnerFlow is a visual analytics interface designed for educators to explore usage patterns in learning materials. This version of the dashboard is repurposed to run on a local web-server. The dashboard offers the following features:

## Features:

### Dashboard Widgets:
1. Filter Panel: Date Range, Student & Annotation Filters
2. Flow View
3. Minimap View
4. Matrix View
5. Annotation Listing

### Filter Panel:
Interactive filtering mechanisms that allow you to explore a vast amount of interaction data and focus on specific user segments of interest.

### Exploring Annotations:
- Text View provides a conventional presentation of annotation listings and is linked to the MiniMap View.
- It displays important attributes such as the author of the annotation, timestamp, annotation text/message, module reference, and annotation category.

### Matrix View:
The matrix diagram shares the same horizontal module axis with the Minimap. It displays engagement dynamics of different user groups and enables simultaneous comparison of annotations and reading time.

### Flow View:
Utilizes a sankey diagram to provide a macroscopic overview of student trajectories within the syllabi. Each node or rectangle represents a learning module, and the arcs represent the trajectories followed by students. It facilitates the investigation of intended and unintended navigation sequences.

### Stressed Modules:
"Stressed" modules are those with a large number of unintended flows. The Flow View helps educators understand where students came from (module) and where they went, which can explain certain behaviors exhibited by students in that module.

## Specific Use-Cases:
LearnerFlow supports various use-cases for educators, including:
1. Student Challenge and Difficulty: Identifying modules where students face difficulties.
2. Content Presentation: Identifying issues with the structure or sequence of topics.
3. Student Engagement: Determining which modules students are reading and which they are not.
4. Content Adequacy: Identifying comprehensiveness, errata, and cues of redundant content.

Please explore LearnerFlow to leverage these features and gain valuable insights into learning material usage.
